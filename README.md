Hangman Game
============

# What is this project?
The game is very simple:
  - Draws a random word from list and displays with "dashes" how many letters this word has
  - You can guess if a given letter appeared in a word. If hit, the game finds out where that letter appears in the word (all occurrences). If you missed, the game status infographic changes.
  - If you guess all the letters in the word before using all 6 tries - you win.
  - If you fail more than 6 times, you lose.

# How to play?
The game is launched at the level of the IDE console. Once launched, you have two choices: play the game or go to settings. The choice is made by entering 1 or 2, respectively.

**Start game:**
After starting the game, type the letters or words you want to guess. The picture shows a hangman reflecting how many mistakes you made. Above the image, a list of letters that you have typed so far is displayed.

**Options:**
There are 3 options in this section:
1) Display words - displays all words available on the list
2) Add word - the ability to add a new word to the list
3) Delete word - permanently removes the word from the list
